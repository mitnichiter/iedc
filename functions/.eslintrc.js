// File: functions/.eslintrc.js

module.exports = {

  },
 and Next.js.
2.  **The Cloud Functions Backend (the `functions` folder):** Its rules are for Node.js.

When you run `firebase deploy`, it tries to run the linter (`npm run lint`) inside the `functions` folder. However, the linter gets confused and looks "up" into your main project folder, sees the Next.js rules, and tries to apply them to your backend code. This causes a crash because the environments are incompatible.

### Solution 1: The Best Fix

The best way to fix this is to tell the backend linter to stop looking outside its own folder.

1.  In your code editor, navigate into the `functions` folder.
2.  Open the ESLint configuration file named `.eslintrc.js`.
3.  Add one line to the top of the file: **`root: true,`**.

This one line tells ESLint: "This is the root of the project. Stop looking in parent folders for any other configuration files."

Here is the full content of your `functions/.eslintrc.js` file after the change:

```javascript
// File: functions/.eslintrc.js

module.exports = {
  root: true, // <-- ADD THIS LINE
  env: {
    es6: true,
    node: true,
  },
  extends: [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "google",
  ],
  rules: {
    quotes: ["error", "double"],
  },
};
